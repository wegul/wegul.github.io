I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Vishal Shrivastav](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~vshriva/) and [Sonia Fahmy](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/fahmy/) at [PurNet Lab](https://gitlab.com/purnet-lab/purnet-lab.gitlab.io/-/wikis/home).
Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Hunan University, where I spent two wonderful years working with Prof. [Daibo Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/dbliuuestc/). 
Here is my [CV](https://wegul.github.io/files/weigaoCV-10_2024.pdf).

<!-- *I will join Purdue University in 2022Fall for Ph.D. study. Boiler Up!!!* -->




Research
======
My interests center around the design and optimization of systems for resource disaggregation inside datacenters. I take a holistic approach to push the envelope, spanning from low-level hardware design to high-level kernel optimizations. Specifically, my key projects are:
- Leveraging new hardwares to improve the performance of memory disaggregation [[ASPLOS'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08300)];   
- Adapting cache coherence to disaggregated rack with high utilization and minimum latency;    
- Evaluating and unlocking the 'real' boundaries of packet processing capability in host network stack.   


<!-- I also have keen appetite for many other areas. Check my [personal insights](https://wegul.github.io/wegul/year-archive/) of some recent works and feel free to leave a message, I would be more than happy to share my thoughts. -->
