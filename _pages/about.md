I am a senior year B.Eng student in the College of Computer Sciences and Electronic Engineering at Hunan University, supervised by Prof. [Daibo Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/dbliuuestc/home). 
<!-- This is my [CV](https://github.com/wegul/wegul/raw/main/files/weigaosu_CV.pdf). -->

*I will join Purdue University in 2022Fall for Ph.D. study. Go Boilers!!!*




Research Interests
======
I have broad interests in network and mobile research. Particularly in the following topics:  
- Security and privacy  
- Mobile computing  
- Wireless network  
- Internet QoE

I also have keen appetite for many other areas. Check my [personal insights](https://wegul.github.io/wegul/year-archive/) of some recent works and feel free to leave a message, I would be more than happy to share my thoughts.

Publications
======
*“Towards Device Independent Eavesdropping on Telephone Conversations with Built-in Accelerometer”*  [PDF](https://github.com/wegul/wegul/raw/main/files/Vibphone_arxiv.pdf)  
**Weigao Su**, Daibo Liu, Taiyuan Zhang, Hongbo Jiang.  
Proceedings of the ACM on IMWUT 5.4, 2021.


Current Project
======  
*Optimizing Video Streaming for High-speed Rails*  
- Modeled TCP measurements in high speed rails to disclose the root cause of network degradation.
- Researched LTE behavior with worsened channel quality.
- Revisited current ABR strategies to show the underlying  deficiency.
- Designed a crowdsourcing-based video delivery framework to ensure QoE for passengers on HSR.
