I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Vishal Shrivastav](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~vshriva/) and [Sonia Fahmy](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/fahmy/) at [PurNet Lab](https://gitlab.com/purnet-lab/purnet-lab.gitlab.io/-/wikis/home).
Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Hunan University, where I spent two wonderful years working with Prof. [Daibo Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/dbliuuestc/). 
Here is my [CV](https://wegul.github.io/files/weigaoCV-10_2024.pdf).

Research
======
My interests center around the design and optimization of systems for resource disaggregation inside datacenters. I take a holistic approach to push the envelope, spanning from low-level hardware design to high-level kernel optimizations. Specifically, my key projects are:
- Tweaking network hardwares to improve the performance of remote memory access [[ASPLOS'25](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3669940.3707221)];   
- Adapting cache coherence to disaggregated rack with high utilization and minimal latency [In submission];    
- Improving GPU communication efficiency in ML clusters for better GPU utilization rate and job completion time.
