I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Vishal Shrivastav](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~vshriva/) and [Sonia Fahmy](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/fahmy/) at [PurNet Lab](https://gitlab.com/purnet-lab/purnet-lab.gitlab.io/-/wikis/home).
Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Hunan University, where I spent two wonderful years working with Prof. [Daibo Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/dbliuuestc/). 
Here is my [CV](https://wegul.github.io/files/weigaoCV-10_2024.pdf).



Research
======
My research centers on the design and development of resource-disaggregated system in data center, covering hardware architectures as well as application and OS kernel-level advancements.

- Design network hardwares to improve the performance of disaggregated memory access [[ASPLOS'25](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3669940.3707221)];   
- Build cache coherence protocol for large-scale memory disaggregation [In submission];    
- Enabling high-efficiency GPU communication in AI clusters [In progress]
- Co-design NIC hardware and network subsystems to enhance CPU cache affinity for zero-copy packet processing..
