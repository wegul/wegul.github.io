Background
===
While high-speed rail (HSR) systems provide an efficient way of door-to-door transportation, they also pose unprecedented challenges in Internet service for the passengers-throughput severely degrades in high-speed mobility scenarios. Therefore, researchers have made effort to measure the performance of mobile data network in HSR crossing different geographic areas in order to pinpoint the throughput bottleneck, demystify TCP in high mobility environment and, most importantly, remedy the situation.


Methodology
===
Since this topic is held in field experiments, several tools are thereby proposed, such as Mobiperf [^1], MobiNet [^2],  and MobileInsight [^3]. Mobiperf is an open source application for measuring throughput and latency on mobile platforms. Compared with Mobiperf, MobiNet is more dedicated, capturing not only information of network usage, i.e., measure cellular network performance, but also RSS, information of celltowers and GPS information but I cannot find an opensource copy and the app is removed from the market. While MobiNet is custom-made, MobileInsight has a more general purpose. It serves as a tool that collects, analyzes and exploits runtime network information from operational cellular networks. In order to extract cellular operations from signaling messages without extra help, this app leverages a side channel inside smarphones-control messages that regulate utility function of radio access, service quality, etc.
Personally, I understand it as a strengthened QXDM that is exclusive to Qualcomm devices but without support of a PC and purchasing. Besides, Peng et al. are still maintaining it. 

It is never too verbose to describe tools used by different works because they represent different research emphasis.  Despite network performance being as an end-to-end concept in transport layer, some researchers conduct analysis starting from cellular systems because high speed casts passive impact on channel quality.  Gong et al. [^doppler] acknowledge millimeter wave’s bandwidth edge over conventional LTE communication, discuss several challenges brought by high mobility and propose a method to compensate Doppler effect to improve PHY rate, which beds only in communication between celltower and UE.

With regard to experiments, researchers usually select a specific line to collect traces. For stringency, they collect a huge amount of data, including throughput, packet loss, RTT and conduct experiments to show how HSR is influencing these metrics and TCP's adaptability to high mobility. Specially, congestion control is widely discussed. After disclosing the problems, researchers then give their solutions. However, in spite of the different aspects where researchers set off, they reach a consensus that **handover is the biggest killer**. Next, I will talk about how this notion is shaped in different ways.






Analysis
===
In general, LTE network on HSR manifests several symptoms of deterioration including packet loss and RTT spike, resulting in throughput variation. 

Intuitively, the increasing mobility causes issues such as Doppler frequency offset, fast multi-path fading, and inter-channel/inter-carrier interference, which are all believed to be exacerbating channel quality. Xiao et al. [^2] plot RSRP diagrams to show that signal strength is weak and fluctuating while there are even coverage holes. However, their results show that the signal strength is around good and average for the most time even if weak signal leads to low throughput, suggesting channel quality is not the main contributor to worsened network condition. Similarly, Li et al. [^longtitude] quantitively compare the impact factor of speed, which is rather minor.

Bearing that in mind, to show the degree of network degradation in different situations, most works present throughput traces labeled with handover moments to imply that it is the main factor  as throughput fluctuates at a handover while remains relatively stable without it. HSR leads to frequent handovers and makes them more likely to fail. Since the connection is cut off temporarily during a handover, packets are either lost or delayed. Given that, Wang et al. conclude that handovers have both instantaneous effect and near effect from the perspective of congestion control (packet loss and retransmission) and that handovers can be divided into several types depending on end states. Likewise, Xiao et al.[^longtitude] defines different situations of handovers by network type, which, however, is no longer available because LTE is widely deployed. 

Now that handover is well defined, aside from the general impact brought by handovers (e.g., throughput variation), Li et al.[^mptcp] measure flow with diverse sizes to investigate how handover influence content delivery differently. From the result, mice flow is troubled with sub-flow's handover establishment while elephant flow is constrained by congestion control and scheduling to handovers. 

Some solutions are proposed to enhance TCP performance. Wang et al. [^longtitude] conduct a dual-method measurement to evaluate two popular TCP protocols (i.e., CUBIC and BBR) and propose a supplement a rule of congestion control to boost the throughput. There are also studies that discuss MPTCP. Liu et al. suggests that MPTCP could bring benefits by providing a more reliable retransmission machanism, while Li et al. [^mptcp] argues MPTCP is only advantageous at relatively worse paths.




Summary
===
- Network on HSR is worsened for throughput variation, yet a reasonable throughput is achievable. 
- Channel quality is only a minor factor
- Handover influences throughput in two ways: sudden drop & long recovery because both TCP's bandwidth probing strategy and RTT estimation do not adapt to dynamics in a agile way




Discussion
===
Prior works expose TCP behaviors in dynamic setting, and further investigate the impact of handover that is neglected for some days. However, there is still a missing piece in the area of HSR network performance analysis.

Throughput variation is even more harmful to data consuming applications like video delivery as Wang et al. show that users are discouraged to watch videos on HSR. Living in an era where everyone is watching short videos, QoE of HSR passengers raise little attention of the academic field. 

While TCP fails to adjust in dynamic settings on its own, recent video delivery framework like DASH is known for its adaptability to different network situation. Since we have more control on application layer protocol, is cross-layer design a solution towards remedy of video delivery on HSR? 

Thoughts
===
Personally, I think researchers are taking it for granted that the bottleneck of content delivery always lies in LTE network because it "seems" lame comparing with intimidating capacity of data center. This sided belief made us ignore the events in between: Is it possible that we are under-utilizing the bandwidth due to accumulation during the transportation? To answer my question, BurstTracker [^burst] uses MobileInsight and suggests LTE is not always the bottleneck. However, it remains unclear in HSR network.
