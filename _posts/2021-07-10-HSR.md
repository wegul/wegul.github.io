Background
===
While high-speed rail (HSR) systems provide an efficient way of door-to-door transportation, they also pose unprecedented challenges in Internet service for the passengers-throughput severely degrades in high-speed mobility scenarios. Therefore, researchers have made effort to measure the performance of mobile data network in HSR crossing different geographic areas in order to pinpoint the throughput bottleneck, demystify TCP in high mobility environment and, most importantly, remedy the situation.


Methodology
===
Since this topic is held in field experiments, several tools are thereby proposed, such as Mobiperf [^1], MobiNet [^2],  and MobileInsight [^3]. Mobiperf is an open source application for measuring throughput and latency on mobile platforms. **Despite throughput as a concept in transport layer, some researchers conduct analysis starting from cellular systems because high speed casts passive impact on channel quality.** Compared with Mobiperf, MobiNet is more dedicated, capturing not only information of network usage, i.e., measure cellular network performance, but also RSS, information of celltowers, GPS information, data connection state and handover occurrence but I cannot find an opensource copy and the app is removed from the market. While MobiNet is custom-made, MobileInsight has a more general purpose. It serves as a tool that collects, analyzes and exploits runtime network information from operational cellular networks. In order to extract cellular operations from signaling messages without extra help, this app leverages a side channel inside smarphones-control messages that regulate utility function of radio access, service quality, etc.
Personally, I understand it as a strengthened QXDM that is exclusive to Qualcomm devices but without support of a PC and purchasing. Besides, Peng et al. are still maintaining it.

Besides those mentioned, Gong et al. propose a method to compensate Doppler effect with mmWave, mainly to improve PHY rate.xxxx

With the tools, researchers usually select a specific line to collect data. For stringency, they collect a huge amount of data, including throughput, packet loss, RTT and conduct experiments to show how HSR is influencing these metrics. Among those, Li et al.[longtitude] quantatively compare the impact factor of speed and handovers to show that the latter one casts more negative influence. Some solutions are proposed to enhance TCP performance. Wang et al. [^4] conduct a dual-method measurement to evaluate two popular TCP protocols (i.e., CUBIC and BBR) and propose a supplement a rule of congestion control to boost the throughput. There are also studies that discuss MPTCP. Liu et al. suggests that MPTCP could bring benefits by providing a more reliable retransmission machanism, while Li et al. [mptcp] argues MPTCP is only advantageous at relatively worse situations.
