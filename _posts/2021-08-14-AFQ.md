This paper is published in NSDI '18.

**Disclaimer:**  
There are terms that I am unfamiliar with since the paper sort of lies out side of my current research experience but I will try to explain as clear with plain words : )

Summary
===
This paper develops an approximate form of Fair Queueing with reconfigurable switches. 


<!-- We leverage configurable perpacket processing and the ability to maintain mutable
state inside switches to achieve fair bandwidth allocation across all traversing flows. Further, present our
design for a new dequeuing scheduler, called Rotating
Strict Priority scheduler that lets us transmit packets from
multiple queues in approximate sorted order. Our hardware emulation and software simulations on a large leafspine topology show that our scheme closely approximates ideal Fair Queueing, improving the average flow
completion times for short flows by 2-4x and 99th tail
latency by 4-8x relative to TCP and DCTCP. -->
