*This post summarizes my perception of wireless security into a mindmap.*

Overview
===
The broadcast nature of radio makes wireless communication vulnerable. In the view of network architecture, from SQL injection to IP hijacking and MAC spoofing, the attackers are no less evil to any of the protocols. Even worse, beyond communication, as wireless signals can sense the status of surrounding objects, people's privacy is further exposed-more sensing, more threats.
Based on my experience, by linking sensing with security, I would discuss some potential future line of research in a mindmap.
